Notes:
  - Keyboard structure finished. ✅

  - Give HR lines margin-bottom's and join them together to prevent too much clogging of CSS. ✅

  - Change background-color on the body element to black. ✅

  - Fix the Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause Break keys and make them aligned with all the other keys. ✅

  - Change the background image of the keyboard to something nicer once all the keys are added in and colored.  ✅

  - Make a Github file with all my projects starting with this one as my first ever project. ✅
